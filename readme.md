# Google Chat Pretty Paste Code Block Extension 

The sole purpose of this google chrome extension is to make it easy to share 
source code directly in google chat, some time's dev's collaborating each other  send quick code snippets 
over google chat, while google chat provides formatting of code using three back ticks 
but that consume time and is ignored as extra step. 
This chrome extension does it for you automatically .

Ctrl + Shift + V (Linux, Windows)
Cmd + Shift + V(Mac)

For normal text you can still use the default paste shortcut.
